# Financial Planner

An [Agent Skill](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that answers real-world personal-finance decision questions the way a **financial planner** would — grounded in four specific frameworks rather than generic "pay off your debt" advice.

It classifies debt (oppressive / working / enriching), computes after-tax spreads and NPVs, enforces a foundation-first gate, preserves liquidity across competing goals, and weights life-stage utility when there is genuine surplus.

## Layout

```
SKILL.md                              # router + persona + unified decision tree (always loaded)
references/
  value-of-debt.md                    # Anderson — debt taxonomy, glide-path, liquidity
  corporate-finance.md                # Brealey/Myers/Allen — NPV, opportunity cost, WACC
  financial-planning-process.md       # Leimberg — cash-flow planning, 7 steps, foundation-first
  die-with-zero.md                    # Perkins — lifetime fulfillment, personal interest rate
  synthesis-and-examples.md           # conflict resolution + worked examples
```

`SKILL.md` is the only file an agent loads automatically. It routes to the reference files, which cost nothing until opened.

## Sources

| Source | Role in the skill |
|---|---|
| **The Value of Debt in Building Wealth** — Thomas J. Anderson | Debt taxonomy, after-tax return equivalence, liquidity as insurance, glide-path D/A ratios by net-worth-to-income |
| **Principles of Corporate Finance** — Brealey, Myers & Allen | NPV rule, opportunity cost of capital, after-tax cost of debt, WACC (the neutral arithmetic layer) |
| **The Tools & Techniques of Financial Planning** — Leimberg et al. | Cash-flow planning as the outer loop, seven-step process, emergency reserve + catastrophic-risk insurance before any optimization |
| **Die with Zero** — Bill Perkins | Objective function = lifetime fulfillment; memory dividend; age-rising personal interest rate; survival threshold; net-worth peak |

## What it does

| Capability | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Debt-vs-cash tradeoffs** | Classifies the debt first, computes the after-tax spread, and only then recommends pay-down, keep, or restructure |
| **Multi-goal sequencing** | Treats the problem as cash-flow timing; runs a liquidity stress test that sits *above* raw NPV so one goal cannot strand another |
| **Leverage sizing** | Glide-path D/A targets by net-worth-to-income band; securities-based borrowing capped ~25% of portfolio |
| **Life-stage utility** | Once foundation and survival threshold are clear, applies Perkins' rising personal interest rate to age-locked experiences |
| **Explicit sensitivity** | Every recommendation states the numbers assumed and *exactly what would flip the answer* |

## Install

Clone into your agent's skill directory. For Claude Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariel-lee-1023/Financial-planner.git ~/.claude/skills/financial-planner
```

Other hosts use different roots — e.g. `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, or `.claude/skills/` for project scope. The directory name becomes the skill name; keep it `financial-planner` to match the `name:` in `SKILL.md`.

## Usage

Ask normally; the skill triggers on personal-finance decision questions of the form "should I pay cash or borrow", "pay off the loan or invest", "fund goal A without stranding goal B", refinance / restructure, retirement drawdown sequencing, etc.

Expect answers shaped like:

> Situation restatement → debt classification + after-tax spread(s) with numbers → liquidity / stress check → recommendation → sensitivity note ("this flips if …").

It will ask for missing rates, tax treatment, timelines, reserves, and insurance status before advising into a vacuum.

## What kind of distillation this is

Structure, not summary. Each reference file preserves the authors' own framework names and exact formulations, defines key terms inline, and ends with explicit **when it applies / does not** limits so the agent does not over-apply a book outside its stated domain. Nothing is copied verbatim at length; everything is synthesized for decision use.

## Scope and limitations

Strong on debt classification, after-tax cost-of-capital arithmetic, multi-goal liquidity, foundation-first ordering, and life-stage utility tradeoffs.

Out of scope by design: tax-return preparation, securities picking, single-objective factual lookups, and anything that requires a licensed advisor's signature. The skill is instructed to say so when the stakes warrant.
